## About problem:  
N(<=35000) element is given. Divide them into K parts, so that their sum become maximum. Each part result is number of different element in it.

  

## Problem Idea:  

 1. I use divide and conquer for the solution.
 2. For cost calculation I just use sqrt-root decomposition way of left and right sifting.
