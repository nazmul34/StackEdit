# SPOJ - GS

## About problem:  
A tree of N(<=15) node is given. From a node a parson can visit all its adjacent node. Form a node there are probability of visiting each adjacent node. A starting and ending node is given. Find the expected number of move to reach at the end. 
  

## Problem Idea:  

 1. I use gaussian elimination to solve this problem. For calculation of all the equation of expected value, gaussian elimination is needed.
