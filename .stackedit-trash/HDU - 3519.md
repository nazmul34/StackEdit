##  Problem Idea:
Here n is number of coin.  
Number of possible way is 2^n. The question is : find the number of way in which more than two continuous coins are in same state. We could find number of ways in which coins don't have more than two continuous coins in same state. We run dp solution and found a pattern  that ,  
**dp[i] = dp[i-1] +dp[i-2]**    
  
Finally the ans is:  
  
**ans = 2^n - dp[n]**
