# 1288 - Subsets Forming Perfect Squares
##  Problem Idea:

 1. Less then 300 , there are only 62 prime number. So, we can use 64 bit number to represent this 62 prime number. Each bit of a number represents a prime number.
 2. First of all, we prime factorize each of n number and if a number have a odd number of 2 in it's factorization then we add 1 bit at 0th position. If odd number of 3 exist then we add 1 bit at 1th position. We should do this same thing to other prime number.
 3. Finally when we
