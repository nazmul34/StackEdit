## About problem:  
A tree of n node is given. Eac
  

## Problem Idea:  

 1. This problem can be solved by DP. But how can we check which number we have taken. n=100 so bitmask is not possible.
 2.  We can find those number by using x. If x==gcd(x,number) then we can find how many number with common gcd x is taken. Other number is not taken . We have a count that keeps how many number is already taken. So can find those number which gcd is already x but not taken.
