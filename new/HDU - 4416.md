## About problem:
String A and n string B[n] is given. Find number of distinct substring which is belong to A but not belong to any of B[i] (**1<=i<=n**) as substring.
## Problem Idea:

 1. First of all, I put all the n string to the suffix automata. And count number of different substring **L1**.
 2. Then I put string A to the suffix automata and count number of different substring **L2**.
 3. Finally count the **result = L2 - L1** .
 4. If we do step 2 before  step 1, then the ans would not valid.
 5.
