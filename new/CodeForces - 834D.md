## About problem:  
N(<=35000) element is given. Divide them into K parts, so that their sum become maximum. Each part result is number of different element.

  

## Problem Idea:  

 1. I use divide and conquer for the solution.
 2. For pre-processing  I use a while loop to find that particular suitable value.
