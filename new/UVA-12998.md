# UVA-12998

## About problem:  
A rooted tree with N nodes is given. Nodes are labeled 1 to N, 1 being the root of the tree. Each of the leaves of this tree has a value assigned to it, which is zero at the beginning. The value for each internal node U is calculated as the sum of the values of all the nodes in the sub-tree rooted at U. An internal node is a node, which has at least one child node. You will be given two kinds of operations:   
 Type 1: given U, find the value of node U.   
Type 2: given U and X, increase the value of the leaf U with X.
  

## Problem Idea:  

 1. We can find each node sub-tree child nodes range for segment tree  by  dfs.
 2. when command to add a value "x" we add at the leaf 2^(level_of_the_node-1)*x.
 3. Ans is: sum_of_all_leaf_node/(2^(level_of_that_node-(if leaf node then 1 or 0))
