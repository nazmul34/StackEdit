## About problem:  
P point(x,y) is given. Find maximum convex hull area with N points. (N<=P<=100)
  

## Problem Idea:  

 1. First find those point which form convex hull area of size "s".
 2. In the problem statement s>=N.
 3. Then I run DP to select the exact N points. In DP each time I add a triangle(first,previous and current point) to find the maximum area.
