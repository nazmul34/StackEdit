## About problem:

A string is given. Find the number of distinct substring which occurs at least two times in the string. But here overlapping should not be counted. In string "ababa", substring "aba" cannot counted as 2 occurrence, it is only one occurrence. 

## Problem Idea:


 1. First of all run suffix array code and find LCP. 
 2. For each size of length (i) find all the continuous occurrence of index of suffix array where LCP is greater then the length(i).
 3. In this continuous sorted array (according to starting index) if the difference between leftmost and rightmost array is greater than length(i) we should increase ans by one.  

*Why leftmost and rightmost is used?*  
ans: In those continuous sequence, there can be only one string with length i. If we choose most distance area(left and right most) then it is the best way to get a string which is not overlapped. If it is overlapped then all other combination must be overlapped.
