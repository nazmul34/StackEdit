# 1272 - Maximum Subset Sum
##  Problem Idea:
Actually the problem is:  From A1^ A2 ^ .......^An find a subset which produce maximum result.   
Each number is 64 bit. By using this bit we could consider each number as a row of 64 element of a matrix. Now we could use Gaussian elimination in this matrix. After this elimination each row of the new matrix represent a number. At first ans = 0. From row 0 to n-1   if valur
