## About problem:

## Problem Idea:  

 1. The solution for the problem is min cost max flow.
 2. At first greedy way we cut those edge of the tree which a>b .(a is not cutting cost and b is cutting cost).  
 3. if a<b then cutting is not a good option. So we add those node to in[v]++,out[u]++.
 4. Then I run a code to solve a matching between extra in
