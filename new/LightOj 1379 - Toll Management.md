## About problem:  
A graph is given with 1000 node and 50000 edge. Find those path from **s** to **t** which cost is less then **p** .Print the size of maximum edge cost from all those path.
  

## Problem Idea:  

 1. I use gaussian elimination to solve this problem. For calculation of all the equation of expected value, gaussian elimination is needed.
