# POJ - 3017
## About problem:  
Given an integer sequence { _an_ } of length _N_, you are to cut the sequence into several parts every one of which is a consecutive sub sequence of the original sequence. Every part must satisfy that the sum of the integers in the part is not greater than a given integer _M_. You are to find a cutting that minimizes the sum of the maximum integer of each part.
  

## Problem Idea:  

 1. The problem is solved with monotonic queue.
 2. I maintain a deque to maintain the maximum value.
 3. When sum of the range is greater than M  or maximum value is in front of the queue , I remove element from queue.
 4. For each node I calculated the DP[i] using all the element of the deque.
