# POJ - 3017
## About problem:  
Given an integer sequence { _an_ } of length _N_, you are to cut the sequence into several parts every one of which is a consecutive sub sequence of the original sequence. Every part must satisfy that the sum of the integers in the part is not greater than a given integer _M_. You are to find a cutting that minimizes the sum of the maximum integer of each part.
  

## Problem Idea:  

 1. First find those point which form convex hull area of size "s".
 2. In the problem statement s>=N.
 3. Then I run DP to select the exact N points. In DP each time I add a triangle(first,previous and current point) to find the maximum area.).
