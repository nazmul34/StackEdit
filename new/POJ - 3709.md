## About problem:  
[K-Anonymous Sequence](https://vjudge.net/problem/POJ-3709)
  

## Problem Idea:  

 1. The problem is solved with monotonic queue.
 2. I maintain a deque to maintain the maximum value.
 3. When sum of the range is greater than M  or maximum value is in front of the queue , I remove element from queue.
 4. For each node I calculated the DP[i] using all the element of the deque.
