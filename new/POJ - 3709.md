## Problem Idea:  

Solution for the problem is:    
**dp[i] = dp[j] + sum[i] -sum[j] - (i-j)*a[j+1] ...... ( j>=k and j<=(i-k) )**   
I solved it by convex hull DP tricks.  
In this tricks, equation is like **y=mx+c**.   
Here, c = dp[j]-sum[j] + j*a[j+1]  and  m = -a[j+1]   
Each query we just give x = i;   
dp[i] = query(i) + sum[i]
